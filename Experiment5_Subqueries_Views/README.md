# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views
# Name: SNEGA G
# Reference Number: 212223060266
## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**

From the following tables, write a SQL query to find all the orders issued by the salesman 'Paul Adam'. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id and salesman_id.

```sql
SELECT o.ord_no,o.purch_amt,o.ord_date,o.customer_id,o.salesman_id FROM orders o
JOIN salesman s ON o.salesman_id=s.salesman_id
WHERE s.name='Paul Adam';
```

**Question 5**
---
From the following tables, write a SQL query to find those salespeople who earned the maximum commission. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, and salesman_id.
```sql
SELECT o.ord_no, o.purch_amt, o.ord_date, o.salesman_id
FROM orders o
JOIN salesman s ON o.salesman_id = s.salesman_id
WHERE s.commission = (
    SELECT MAX(commission) FROM salesman
);

**Question 6**
---
Write a SQL query that retrieves the names of students and their corresponding grades, where the grade is equal to the maximum grade achieved in each subject.

```sql
SELECT student_name,grade FROM GRADES g
WHERE grade=(SELECT MAX(grade) FROM GRADES WHERE subject=g.subject);
```

**Output:**

**Question 7**
---
Write a SQL query that retrieve all the columns from the table "Grades", where the grade is equal to the maximum grade achieved in each subject.

```sql
SELECT * FROM GRADES g
WHERE grade=(SELECT MAX(grade) FROM GRADES WHERE subject=g.subject);
```

**Output:**
